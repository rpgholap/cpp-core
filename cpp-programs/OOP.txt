Object Oriented Programming:

Why OOP?
- as the size of the Program increases readability, and bug free nature of the Program decrease (Major Problem)
- data security  --> solve using classes 

Difference b/w POP and OOP:
1. in POP, Set of intructions for computer to follow whereas OOP works on classes and objects.
2. The main focus of POP is on functions and not on the flow of data whereas in OOP class is a template to create Object
   and it treats data as a critical element.

Basic concepts in OOP:
-> Classes: Basic template for creating objects.
-> Objects: Basic run-time entities
-> Encapsulation & Data Abstraction : Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
-> Inheritance: Properties of classes can be inherited into others.
-> Polymorphism: Ability to take more than one forms
-> Dynamic Binding: Code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
-> Message Passing: Message (information) call format


Benefits of OOP:
1. better code reusability using objects and Inheritance
2. Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
3. Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference 
4. S/w complexity can be easily managed.
